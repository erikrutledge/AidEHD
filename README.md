## Aid-EHD - Overview
---
Aid-EHD was created to aid people struggling with ADHD. I got this idea from my wife who requested a tool to solve a specific problem that she has. She'll begin working on a task and as distractions come she, without realizing, will abandon her original project in favor of the most recent stimulus that catches her eye. She requested an app that would help her stay focused and remind her what she was doing in regular intervals so she can finish what she starts. The app is only a single screen with a text field, 2 sliders and a button. The user should input the task they want to accomplish in the first field, then move the sliders until they reflect accurately how long the task should take, and how often they would like to be reminded (in minutes). At the press of the button the phone will schedule notifications at regular intervals over the selected time period that remind the user what they should be doing.

## Development Environment
---
This project was created in Xcode, written in the Swift programming language and is currently only supported on apple IOS devices.

## Future Improvements
---
- I would like to add a visual to the screen when the button gets pressed to indicate that the notifications have been started.
- I would like to add a way for the user to clear all past notifications at the press of a button. Right now they just have to close the app and everything is cleared.
- In addition to a visual indicator that notifications have been added to the queue, it would be great to have a visual countdown until the next notification comes through.
- Currently the app is not on the app store, but that is the plan.
